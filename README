REQUIREMENTS :

  - GNU build system (GCC, GNU Make, GNU Bison and GNU Flex)
  - (optional) Smodels 2.27 library (built with make lib)

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS :

  1. From the toplevel source directory, run ./configure :

    $ ./configure

    The following configure options are avaliable:

      --with-smodels

        Compile with smodels support (default is without smodels support). This
        assumes that the smodels library and header files are installed in the
        system.

      --with-smodels=<path-to-smodels>

        Alternatively, the path to the directory containing the full smodels
        source tree (compiled) can be specified.

      --enable-strip

        Runs strip against the executable file to reduce disk footprint size.

      --enable-debug

        Compile with -g and enable printing of debug messages.

      --enable-static

        Enable building of statically-linked binaries as opposed to the default
        dynamic linking. Only available in systems that support dynamic linking.

      --enable-wrapper

        Enable C-style library wrapper for non-C++ linking.

      --prefix=<path-to-install>

        Install executable, header files and libraries into the specified path.
        Default is /usr/local. Run ./configure --help for more details.

      --help

        Suppress normal configuration and output help message.

      --version

        Suppress normal configuation and output version number.

  2. Then run make :

    $ make

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS :

  Optionally, the package (executable, header files and libraries) may
  be installed in the system by invoking the make command with the install
  parameter :

    $ make install

  To uninstall, simply run make with the uninstall parameter:

    $ make uninstall

USAGE :

  The executable binary will be in dist/bin/vlad. Usage is as follows:

    ./dist/bin/vlad -h|-v|[-e] policy-filename [agent-filename]

  where:

    policy-filename is the name of the file that contains the policy.
    agent-filename  is the name of the file that contains agent directives.

  For each query directive in the agent file, vLad will print to stdout a
  normal logic program that models the input program, the translations and
  the queries. If the -e option is given, vLad will print one of three
  possible query results:

    TRUE   - query is true
    FALSE  - query is false
    ?      - there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether query is true
             or false.

  Without the agent-filename parameter, vLad will read the queries from stdin.

  To use the test files in the samples directory :

    $ ./dist/bin/vlad sample/cwall.vlp sample/cwall.vla
