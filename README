1. From the toplevel source directory, run ./configure :

     $ ./configure

     The following configure options are avaliable:

     --with-smodels

       Compile with smodels support (default is without smodels support). This
       assumes that the smodels library and header files are installed in the
       system.

     --with-smodels=<path-to-smodels>

       Alternatively, the path to the directory containing the full smodels
       source tree (compiled) can be specified.

     --enable-strip

       Runs strip against the executable file to reduce disk footprint size.

     --enable-debug

       Compile with -g and enable printing of debug messages.

     --enable-static

       Enable building of statically-linked binaries as opposed to the default
       dynamic linking. Only available in systems that support dynamic linking.

     --prefix=<path-to-install>

       Install executable, header files and libraries into the specified path.
       Default is /usr/local. Run ./configure --help for more details.

     --help

       Suppress normal configuration and output help message.

     --version

       Suppress normal configuation and output version number.

2. Then run make :

     $ make

3. Optionally, the package (executable, header files and libraries) may
   be installed in the system by invoking the make command with the install
   parameter :

     $ make install

   To uninstall, simply run make with the uninstall parameter:

     $ make uninstall

4. The executable binary will be in dist/bin/vlad. Usage is as follows:

     ./dist/bin/vlad -h|-v|[-e] program-filename [query-filename]

   where:

     program-filename is the name of the file that contains the program.
     query-filename is the name of the file that contains a list of queries.

   For each query statement in the query file, vLad will print to stdout a
   normal logic program that models the input program, the translations and
   the queries. If the -e option is given, vLad will print one of three
   possible query results:

     TRUE   - query is true
     FALSE  - query is false
     ?      - there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that the query is
              true or false

   Without the query-filename parameter, vLad will read the queries from stdin.

   To use the example program in the samples directory :

     $ ./dist/bin/vlad sample/cwall_prog sample/cwall_query
