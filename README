1. From the toplevel source directory, run ./configure :

     $ ./configure

     The following configure options are avaliable:

     --with-smodels

       Compile with smodels support (default is without smodels support). This
       assumes that the smodels library and header files are installed in the
       system.

     --with-smodels=<path-to-smodels>

       Alternatively, the path to the directory containing the full smodels
       source tree (compiled) can be specified.

     --enable-strip

       Runs strip against the executable file to reduce disk footprint size.

     --enable-debug

       Compile with -g and enable printing of debug messages.

2. Then run make :

     $ make

3. The executable binary will be in dist/bin/vlad. Without a filename 
   argument, the program will read input from stdin. Debug output as well
   as errors and warning will be dumped to stderr. Program output will be
   directed to stdout.

   To use the example program in the samples directory :

     $ ./dist/bin/vlad sample/chinese_wall
