	* kb/atom.cpp :
	* kb/atom.h :
	* kb/atomlist.cpp :
	* kb/atomlist.h :

	  - Improved cmp functions.

	  - holds_atom, member_atom and subset_atom now inherits from the atom
	    class. Much cleaner this way.

	* kb/atom.cpp :
	* kb/atom.h :

	  - Added verify function to ensure integrity.

2003-02-24  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* kb/Makefile.in :
	* kb/atomlist.cpp :
	* kb/atomlist.h :

	  - Added atom list class.

	* kb/atom.cpp :
	* kb/atom.h :

	  - Atom class is now a derived class of list_item. This is to make
	    way for the atomlist class.

	  - Added a cmp() function in atom.

2003-02-18  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* configure :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Fixed CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS = -L..\lib to -L../lib

	* common/vlad.h :

	  - Added a macro for new(nothrow)

	  - Changed new(nothrow) to new(std::nothrow) to keep gcc happy.

	* common/list.cpp :
	* kb/atom.cpp :
	* kb/identifier.cpp :
	* kb/symtab.cpp :
	* main/vlad.cpp :
	* parser/parser.y :
	* parser/scanner.l :

	  - Changed include directives to use stdc++ instead of stdc. Was 
	    causing "deprecated" warnings.

	  - Changed to use new macro.

	* main/Makefile.in :

	  - Took out strip --strip-all. Apparently, not all versions of strip 
	    support it.

2003-02-12  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* README :
	* configure :
	* configure.ac :
	* main/Makefile.in :

	  - Added --enable-strip configure option to allow final main binary
	    to be stripped with --strip-all after building.

	* kb/atom.cpp :

	  - Sanity checks to ensure that the identifiers given the 
	    init() functions are valid.

2003-02-11  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* kb/Makefile.in :
	* kb/atom.h :
	* kb/atom.cpp :

	  - Added atom class.


2003-02-04  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* config.h.in :

	  - Added a template file for config.h to be generated
	    by configure.

	  - At the moment only the debug flag and version string are set.

	* Makefile.in :
	* configure.ac :
	* common/Makefile.in :
	* common/vlad.h :
	* kb/Makefile.in :
	* main/Makefile.in :
	* parser/Makefile.in :

	  - Took out -DDEBUG from makefiles.

	  - Cleared out -L and -I from the makefile. Now these options will
	    be generated by configure and passed into the makefiles via the
	    CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables.

	  - Added the current directory in the include path.

	* common/list.cpp :
	* kb/identifier.cpp :
	* kb/symtab.cpp :
	* main/vlad.cpp :
	* parser/parser.y :

	  - All cpp files now includes config.h

	  - All vlad header files are included with <...h> instead of
	    "...h".

2003-01-29  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* parser/parser.y :

	  - Identifiers are now stored in symtab.

	* common/vlad.h :
	* common/list.cpp :

	  - VLAD_NOTUNIQUE is a duplicate of VLAD_DUPLICATE (stupid).

	* kb/identifier.cpp :
	* kb/identifier.h :
	* kb/symtab.cpp :
	* kb/symtab.h :

	  - Replaced identifier type and group flag with an integer to
	    represent both.

	  - Added defines and macros for identifier types.

	  - Modified identifier so that the cmp() function will allow
	    the use of wildcards (name == NULL and type == 0 will match
	    anything).

	  - Added another get() function in symtab to allow an array of
	    identifier of a particular type/group to be retrieved.

2003-10-27  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* kb/identifier.cpp :
	* kb/identifier.h :
	* kb/symtab.cpp :

	  - Renamed the enum identifier type names with an _ident
	    suffix to avoid name clashes with access() in unistd.h.

2003-01-26  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* common/list.cpp :

	  - Fixed default constructor.

	  - Added debug code.

	* kb/symtab.cpp :

	  - Fixed default constructor to call the proper base constructor.

2003-01-26  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* sample/chinese_wall :

	  - Added sample program.

2003-01-25  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.ued.au>

	* common/vlad.h :

	  - Added a new error code for unique-item lists.

	* common/list.cpp :
	* common/list.h :
	* kb/symtab.cpp :

	  - Added a flag to the list to identify whether it should allow
	    identical items to be added or not. Symtab is set to unique.

	  - Added provisions to allow retrieval of identical items from
	    the list. Matching nodes are passed through an array.

	* kb/identifier.cpp :
	* kb/identifier.h :

	  - Added functions to return class attributes.

2003-01-24  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.ued.au>

	* kb/Makefile.in :
	* kb/symtab.h :
	* kb/symtab.cpp :
	* kb/identifier.h :
	* kb/identifier.cpp :

	  - Added a class for the symbol table. To be used to store identifier
	    declarations. Symtab is derived from the list class and uses
	    the identifier class (which in turn is derived from the abstract
	    base class list_item).

	* Makefile.in :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Some changes to generate a Makefile in the kb directory.

	* common/list.cpp :
	* common/list.h :

	  - Some cleanup.

	  - Added a get function in the list class. Only temporary. This
	    will be replaced by a function that will retrieve an array
	    of items that matches instead of just returning the first match.

	* main/Makefile.in :
	* main/vlad.cpp :

	  - Changes to make the main binary link against the new kb lib.

2003-01-22  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* common/list.cpp :
	* common/list.h :
	* common/vlad.h :

	  - Name cleanup.

	* common/list.cpp :
	* common/list.h :

	  - Added an abstract class to be used as the base class for the
	    list item.

	  - Converted the list class to store descendants of the list_item
	    class instead of void pointers. Note that the destructor and
	    cmp() must be implemented by classes that inherits from this
	    class.

2003-01-13  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* common/Makefile.in :
	* common/vlad.h :
	* common/list.h :
	* common/list.cpp :
	* main/Makefile.in :

	  - Added a simple linked-list structure (void *) for general use.

	* configure.ac :

	  - Took out silly lex/yacc testing. Let it fail in the build
	    process.

	* main/Makefile.in :
	* parser/Makefile.in :

	  - Converted build process to C++. Changed lex/yacc output src
	    to end in .cpp instead of .c.

	* main/vlad.c :

	  - Renamed to vlad.cpp.

2002-12-19  Vino Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* Makefile :
	* common/Makefile :
	* parser/Makefile :
	* main/Makefile :

	  - Removed makefiles and replaced them with a corresponding
	    Makefile.in to be generated by the configure script.

	  - Added configure.ac to generate the configure script.

	* README :

	  - Updated README file to describe new build procedure.

	* parser/parser.y :
	* scanner/scanner.l :

	  - Modified to implement changes described below.

	* docs/bnf.txt :

	    with no paramaters to be queried.

	  - Simplified query rules.

	  - Changed as described below.

	* docs/lanspecs.txt :

	  - Now the if-clause of tranformation definitions are optional.

	  - Dropped the "trans" keyword as it is completely useless.

	* main/Makefile :
	* main/vlad.c :

	  - Added main file (borrowed from epilog).

	* common/Makefile :
	* common/vlad.h :

	  - Added a common header file (borrowed from epilog).

	* Makefile :

	  - Added common and main dirs.

	* parser/parser.y :
	* parser/scannel.l :

	  - Changes to implement the bnf changes below.
