	* common/list.cpp :
	* common/list.h :
	* kb/symtab.cpp :

	  - Added provisions to allow retrieval of identical items from
	    the list. Matching nodes are passed through an array.

	* kb/identifier.cpp :
	* kb/identifier.h :

	  - Added functions to return class attributes.

	* kb/Makefile.in :
	* kb/symtab.h :
	* kb/symtab.cpp :
	* kb/identifier.h :
	* kb/identifier.cpp :

	  - Added a class for the symbol table. To be used to store identifier
	    declarations. Symtab is derived from the list class and uses
	    the identifier class (which in turn is derived from the abstract
	    base class list_item).

	* Makefile.in :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Some changes to generate a Makefile in the kb directory.

	* common/list.cpp :
	* common/list.h :

	  - Some cleanup.

	  - Added a get function in the list class. Only temporary. This
	    will be replaced by a function that will retrieve an array
	    of items that matches instead of just returning the first match.

	* main/Makefile.in :
	* main/vlad.cpp :

	  - Changes to make the main binary link against the new kb lib.

	* common/list.cpp :
	* common/list.h :
	* common/vlad.h :

	  - Name cleanup.

	* common/list.cpp :
	* common/list.h :

	  - Added an abstract class to be used as the base class for the
	    list item.

	  - Converted the list class to store descendants of the list_item
	    class instead of void pointers. Note that the destructor and
	    cmp() must be implemented by classes that inherits from this
	    class.

	* common/Makefile.in :
	* common/vlad.h :
	* common/list.h :
	* common/list.cpp :
	* main/Makefile.in :

	  - Added a simple linked-list structure (void *) for general use.

	* configure.ac :

	  - Took out silly lex/yacc testing. Let it fail in the build
	    process.

	* main/Makefile.in :
	* parser/Makefile.in :

	  - Converted build process to C++. Changed lex/yacc output src
	    to end in .cpp instead of .c.

	* main/vlad.c :

	  - Renamed to vlad.cpp.

	* Makefile :
	* common/Makefile :
	* parser/Makefile :
	* main/Makefile :

	  - Removed makefiles and replaced them with a corresponding
	    Makefile.in to be generated by the configure script.

	* configure.ac :

	  - Added configure.ac to generate the configure script.

	* README :

	  - Updated README file to describe new build procedure.
